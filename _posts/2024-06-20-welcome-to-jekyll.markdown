I am currently a Post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oldenburg. This is a 23-month position funded by the [Hearing4All Cluster of Excellence](https://hearing4all.de/en/) and [Hansewissenshaftskolleg (HWK)](https://hanse-ias.de/en/themes/research-areas/brain-mind). The goal of the project is to determine if neurofeedback on auditory selective attention enhances the perception of speech in noisy environments in everyday life.  I work with [Prof. Dr. Stefan Debener](https://uol.de/neuropsychologie/team/prof-dr-stefan-debener) and [Dr. Martin Bleichner](https://uol.de/psychologie/neurophysiologie-des-alltags-emmy-noether-gruppe/team/dr-martin-bleichner).

Previously, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Elisabetta Farella (Head of E3DA Unit, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy) and Dr. Marco Buiatti (Center of Mind and Brain Sciences, University of Trento, Italy) for my PhD thesis titled "Signal Processing Methods for Reliable Extraction of Neural Responses in Developmental EEG" ([Thesis link](https://iris.unitn.it/handle/11572/371709)). I developed a signal processing pipeline tailored for EEG-based developmental cognitive studies. The goal was to extract stimulus-specific neural information from noisy EEG datasets collected from human newborns (0-4 days old) and young infants (12 months old). As part of the ERC project [NeurosoNew](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/842243?isPreviewer=1), I also worked on signal processing algorithms suitable for wearable EEG systems. During my PhD internship at the ESL laboratory, EPFL Switzerland, I worked on Machine Learning models for epileptic seizure detection using a minimal number of EEG channels (supervised by Dr. Tomas Teijeiro and Prof. Dr. David Atienza).
